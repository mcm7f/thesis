	abstract = {Fractals are very often illustrated by digital images, this is a consequence of the widespread availability of electronic and computational equipment. These images are always limited by their pixel resolution. Subsequently the determination of dimensions for such images is restricted practically because for their calculation the range of scales is not infinite. Downscaling the pixel resolution of images to get images with reduced resolution worsens the achievable absolute computational results but surprisingly the changes in these values and especially the changes of the courses of the calculated generalised dimensions give very promising results. This is due to the qualitative nature of these changes with respect to pixel downscaling. This opens the possibility of determining the quality of the estimation of the fractal dimensions of any image with any particular pixel resolution. Furthermore the pattern of changes itself caused by downscaling is different between the individual fractals. Several geometrical fractals (Sierpinski gasket, a fern, a Menger gasket and a modified Menger gasket with circles) as well as an example of a measured fractal, the digital images of cancer invasion studies in vitro were investigated to study the influence of downscaling the pixel resolution of digital images on the estimation of fractal dimensions.},

	abstract = {Most of the known methods for estimating the fractal dimension of fractal sets are based on the evaluation of a single geometric characteristic, e.g. the volume of its parallel sets. We propose a method involving the evaluation of several geometric characteristics, namely all the intrinsic volumes (i.e. volume, surface area, Euler characteristic, etc.) of the parallel sets of a fractal. Motivated by recent results on their limiting behavior, we use these functionals to estimate the fractal dimension of sets from digital images. Simultaneously, we also obtain estimates of the fractal curvatures of these sets, some fractal counterpart of intrinsic volumes, allowing a finer classification of fractal sets than by means of fractal dimension only. We show the consistency of our estimators and test them on some digital images of self-similar sets.},

	abstract = {Fractal properties of real world objects are commonly examined in digital images. Digital images are discrete representations of objects or scenes and are unavoidably contaminated with noise disturbing the representation of the captured objects. We evaluate the noise dependency of frequently applied algorithms for the calculation of the fractal dimension in digital images. Three mathematically defined fractals (Koch Curve, Sierpinski Gasket, Menger Carpet), representative for low, middle and high values of the fractal dimension, together with an experimentally obtained fractal structure were contaminated with well-defined levels of artificial noise. The Box-Counting Dimension, the Correlation Dimension and the rather unknown Tug-of-War Dimension were calculated for the data sets in order to estimate the fractal dimensionality under the presence of accumulated noise. We found that noise has a significant influence on the computed fractal dimensions (relative increases up to 20\%) and that the influence is sensitive to the applied algorithm and the space filling characteristics of the investigated fractal structures. The similarities of the effect of noise on experimental and artificial fractals confirm the reliability of the obtained results.},

	abstract = {Orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) is a dynamic process of bone modeling involving osteoclast-driven resorption on the compression side. Consequently, to estimate the influence of various situations on tooth movement, experimental studies need to analyze this cell. Objectives The aim of this study was to test and validate a new method for evaluating osteoclastic activity stimulated by mechanical loading based on the fractal analysis of the periodontal ligament (PDL)-bone interface. Material and Methods The mandibular right first molars of 14 rabbits were tipped mesially by a coil spring exerting a constant force of 85 cN. To evaluate the actual influence of osteoclasts on fractal dimension of bone surface, alendronate (3 mg/Kg) was injected weekly in seven of those rabbits. After 21 days, the animals were killed and their jaws were processed for histological evaluation. Osteoclast counts and fractal analysis (by the box counting method) of the PDL-bone interface were performed in histological sections of the right and left sides of the mandible. Results An increase in the number of osteoclasts and in fractal dimension after OTM only happened when alendronate was not administered. Strong correlation was found between the number of osteoclasts and fractal dimension. Conclusions Our results suggest that osteoclastic activity leads to an increase in bone surface irregularity, which can be quantified by its fractal dimension. This makes fractal analysis by the box counting method a potential tool for the assessment of osteoclastic activity on bone surfaces in microscopic examination.},

In this paper, we report new experiments on zinc-lead fractal co-deposition. Electrodeposits are grown in special cells at a fixed large value of the zinc ion concentration, while that of the lead ion is increased gradually. A very wide diversity of morphologies are obtained and classified. Most of the deposited domains are almost exclusively Pb or Zn. But certain regions originating at the base cathode, ranging from a short grass alley to dense, grown-up bushes or shrubs, manifest a combined Pb-Zn composition. Composition is determined using scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive x ray measurements as well atomic absorption spectroscopy. Pb domains are characterized by shiny leaf-like and dense deposits as well as flowers with round, balloon-like corollas. The Zn zones display a greater variety of morphologies such as thick trunks and thin and fine branching, in addition to minute 'cigar flower' structures. The various morphologies are analyzed and classified from the viewpoint of fractal nature, characterized by the box-count fractal dimension. Finally, macroscopic spatial alternation between two different characteristic morphologies is observed under certain conditions.},

Regions of interest (100×100 pixels) were located between the teeth of the maxillary anterior, premolar, and molar area, as well as the mandibular anterior, premolar, and molar areas. The fractal dimension (FD) was calculated by using the box counting method. The particle count (PC) and area fraction (AF) analyses were also performed.; Results: There was no significant difference in the FD values among the different groups of age, gender, upper, and lower jaws. The mean FD value was 1.49±0.01. The mean PC ranged from 44 to 54, and the mean AF ranged from 10.92 to 11.85. The values of FD, PC, and AF were significantly correlated with each other except for the upper molar area.; Conclusion: According to the results, patients with normal trabecular pattern showed a FD of approximately 1.5. Based on these results, further investigation would be recommended if the FD value of patient significantly differenct from this number, since the alteration of this value indicates microstructural modification of trabecular pattern of the jaws. Additionally, with periapical radiographs, simple and cost-effective, PC and AF could be used to assess the deviation from the normal.;},

The particles were sampled using hood method under actual cooking process performed in controlled laboratory conditions. The sample preparation was done using wet technique which was also compared to dry technique for transferring particles on to the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grid. The density and parameter fractal dimension 2D-DDf and PDf was calculated using box count algorithm developed using Python language. The 3D-DDf was calculated using ensemble approach and other shape descriptors were also measured using image processing software. The distribution of primary particle, particle agglomerates and tar balls were also studied. The 3D-DDf for particles emitted from traditional cookstove with wood as fuel was 2.42 compared to a lower 3D-DDf of 1.82 in PF cookstove. The 3D-DDf along with fractal prefactor (kg) of 0.7 and 1.4 indicated circular and dense particles emitted from TR cookstove with wood as fuel. On the contrary, with Mix-2 and Mix-3, the particles emitted from improved cookstoves had 3D-DDf\&gt;2 indicating presence of super soot aggregates. The distribution of primary particle and tar balls indicated count median diameter (CMD) in the range of 15–25 nm and 64–104 nm respectively for all cookstove–fuel combinations. The distribution of equivalent area diameter of aggregates showed maximum particles of 300–400 nm range as evident in other physical characterization studies conducted using instruments that work light scattering principle and electrical mobility of particles.},

	abstract = {Public concerns and official pressures around environmental protection as well as exhausting petroleum resources have brought about preferences in studying and applying environmental-friendly polymers instead of synthetic petroleum-based polymers. For this aim, biopolymers can have outstanding advantages in biodegradability by saving time, energy and effort spent on increasingly costs of polymeric wastes. Natural starch (being studied in this work), as one of the most abundant natural resources for polymer materials, is inexpensive and biodegradable. As starch necessarily needs for modifications and processing before being used as ideal green polymer material, it is vital to perform feature extraction and defect detection measures in structure by some method like image analysis. Fractal as a new geometry has circumstantially progressed recently in the fields of image processing, physical space–time, medical image analysis, electrochemical patterns, digital images, sounds etc. Box Count Fractal Dimension as a very important and popular part of fractal geometry can be a useful factor in feature extraction and pattern recognition. This paper presents a new method for defect detection in the structure of natural starch modification images using the fractal dimension (FD) along with mean and standard deviation of image color. This is performed via feature extraction based on artificial intelligence by MatLab R2013a for box counting algorithms. Otsu’s graythresh method by MatLab R2013a is applied to binarize the images. The results of proposed methodology are illustrated as log–log curves where the fractal dimensions are recognized by curve fitting (CF) tool with more than 95\% accuracy. The outputs express that starch samples’ FD vary in the range from 1.636 to 1.926 among which the last is identified as non-defective polymer. Non-defective feature is of great importance for quality control measures and chemical reactivity being here highlighted as biodegradability.},
